A cuticle oil is for hydration, and a cuticle remover loosens the dead skin and makes it easier to push back. So don't be fooled. The cuticle area is very delicate and should never be pushed back without applying a cuticle remover first to soften the skin. Trauma to this area can cause improper nail growth forever, so be careful."

Now, inspired by these backstage secrets, Dior introduces new Dior Addict Lip Polish. Enriched with moisturizing hyaluronic microspheres and ultra-reflective mother-of-pearl pigments, the incredibly supple formula instantly recreates the impeccable, glowing look of the runway. The revolutionary and exclusive spin-on applicator, which picks up just the right amount of product and then rolls it uniformly onto the lips, provides a delicate massage that enhances the benefits of the formula."

This silky serum-gel helps dramatically reduce the look of every key sign of aging around the fragile eye area: Fine lines Wrinkles Puffiness Dark circles Dryness Uneven skintone ENHANCED REPAIR Because skin around your eyes is about 4X thinner than anywhere else on your face, it's more vulnerable to environmental damage. It is also where you'll see the signs of aging to be the most exaggerated. Our exclusive Chronolux\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 Technology helps skin optimize its natural repair processes to reduce the look of the fine lines and wrinkles that can appear first around your eyes. ENVIRONMENTAL REPAIR Neutralizes up to 90%* of environmentally generated free radicals before they can affect skin's appearance. That's key, because the damaging effects of daily UV light, smoke, pollution and even emotional stress can accelerate every key visible sign of aging. This exclusive formula with its powerful AGT Repair Technology continuously repairs the appearance of past damage caused by every one of these major assaults. Keeps the entire eye area looking fresher, more rested and revitalized. PREVENTION AND HYDRATION Creates the optimal environment to keep your eyes looking younger, healthy and radiant. Hyaluronic acid helps skin lock in moisture and strengthen its protective moisture barrier. Powerful anti-oxidants help neutralize environmentally generated free radicals before they can cause future damage. Plus, high levels of soothing anti-irritants and targeted technologies help reduce the look of dark circles, puffiness and crepiness for brighter, smoother skin around the eyes. Give your eyes a younger-looking future."

The stopper evokes the eye of Buddha. A tantalizing floral-oriental perfume, Samsara is a harmonious blend of all-natural essences, including jasmine, ylang ylang, sandalwood and tonka bean.

Its smoked glass dances in the light and features a delicate silver snail and its trail, symbolizing an addictive passionate path of desire that is both distinctive and unusually provocative.

Smooth on a little Pore Perfecting Complexion Primer Potion before foundation (or alone!) to totally minimize the look of pores and fine lines. The velvety, paraben-free formula flashes down to a soft-matte finish, without the greasy, heavy feel sometimes associated with foundation primers. The result? Flawless skin with an airbrushed look and feel. Foundation applies smoothly, evenly, and won't fade away. Ideal for oilier skin, but dry complexions who want pore perfection will love it, too."

aS'Indulge your lashes with the hardest working mascara on the planet. Our unique formula delivers instant length and volume and allows them to grow LONGER! Nourish, thicken and lengthen your lashes \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c from the inside out. Infused with Peptides that allow your lashes to grow for a longer period of time (as well as moisturizing Panthenol), this formula builds AND beautifies them simultaneously. The large, unique hourglass-shaped brush provided generous distribution. Use it in conjunction with our serum for even more lash nourishment! This very enduring formula is not technically waterproof, but there was zero smudging or running after road-testing it in a hot yoga class. The outer component features a lush swirl motif. This mascara is perfect for anyone who suffers from brittle, fragile lashes, as well as those with great lashes who want to build and strengthen them even more!'

When we overheard a cry in our office of 'this s*** really works!', we knew we had to share the secret. Who wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want to boost their lash cache? This double-ended miracle worker holds TWO products that really perform. These are clinical results you can take to the beauty bank. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c 25% longer and thicker in 2 weeks \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c 40% in 4 weeks \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c 63% in 6 weeks How does this stuff work? The clear gel-like serum accelerates the growth of your lashes with peptides. Use the tiny brush to apply it at your lash line. It penetrates at the root and stimulates keratin to lengthen, thicken and fortify your lashes. Simply brush it on each night before bed. The conditioning mask applies with a wand and loads your lashes with growth peptides and high potency ingredients like Panthenol and Vitamin E. Your conditioned lashes can now resist loss and breakage from being too dry and brittle. All this all adds up to incredible lash magnification! Now if only your Blackberry worked this well..."

This formula is thicker than your average gloss, but doesn't feel that way. Cushiony, but not sticky, Stardust has staying power and nourishes, too: Jojoba Oil conditions lips, Vitamin E improves moisture retention, and a vanilla-mint flavor keeps things interesting for your makeout partner. The clear, rectangular tube shows off color and sparkle \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c it's like a slice of outer space in a tube \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and you won't be able to keep your hands off the soft-touch black cap.

Even the glittery hues in this collection of high-gloss lip pencils feel smooth on your lips (and leave not a trace of sparkle grit). This conveniently portable pencil's high-gloss shine can be blotted for a more stain-like effect, but no matter how you wear it, the color lasts. Free of mineral oil and paraffin, this formula contains plant-derived ingredients that nourish lips. Because the barrels and boxes are color-matched to each shade, locating the color you want is easy, even in the deep, dark depths of an oversize tote."

Bisabolol calms red eyes ensuring the skin is neutralised before the application of eye shadow.\nPerfect for contact lens wearers this base ensures eye shadow particles stay put and does not deposit in the crease of the eye. Colours are distributed evenly resulting in brighter, more intense pigmentation and even the most basic of eye-shadows become longer lasting and brilliant.\nAn absolute must-have for any eye shadow lover, ARTDECO Eyeshadow base is suitable for any eye shadow and incredibly easy to apply.'

A sheer pigment load gives a natural oomph of color so brows look fuller and more even, and the tiny tapered brush allows for precise application. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re inspired by healthy, face-framing brows and consider brow grooming the last crucial step before heading out into the world: brush your teeth, brush your brows, and then maybe brush your hair.'

It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a new kind of lip color that gives the look and finish of a stain, but that glides on and wears like a tinted balm. Because lipstick shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t complicate your look. Premiering in four important shades designed to look amazing on everyone: two that subtly enhance your natural lip tone, and two for a more saturated look. The effect?

It can be used effectively as a foundation brush, powder brush, contour brush, bronzer brush, stipple brush, blush brush, fan brush, concealer brush, kabuki, or sponge. The bristles are packed in a 3.5 inch horizontal design allowing you to effortlessly and evenly cover larger or smaller surface areas. The density of the brush creates a smooth, even, and airbrushed application every time, taking the guesswork out of brushwork. Flat edges fit the linear contours of your face, while curved corners allow for targeted, more precise application. Long, flexible bristles make a variety of application techniques possible including: targeted application, stippling, blending, contouring, and highlighting. '

aS'Intense, long-wearing color in a weightless, ultrasmooth cr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa8me that glides on easily for precise and even application. More versatile than a liquid liner, it can be brushed on for smooth, dramatic strokes, smudged for a smoky effect, blended over lids as an intense shadow, or traced over the waterline. Formulated to provide 30 seconds to one minute of playtime, you can blend, adjust, and build color before it dries to a fade-resistant, crease-proof finish. Romanesque and Renaissance can be used in the waterline. '

Microfine powders create a thin, flexible film over the lids, allowing for seamless eye shadow application. Cream and powder shadows glide on smooth and wear for hours without creasing or fading. Translucent Perfector works well with light to medium skintones, while Tinted pairs with medium to dark. Both Perfectors can be worn alone for smooth, even lids, or under an eye shadow for extended wear. '

Can be used as eyeliner for cat eye effect. We've all experienced the dreaded clumps and smudges while painting our lashes with wand mascara. Unlike ordinary wand mascara, cake mascara can be reapplied and layered upon without clumping; this means controlled depth and definition. Cake mascaras lasts until consumed and offer increased sanitary protection. The mascara brushes are rinsed with water after use; leaving no bacteria behind. Cake mascaras were the first type of mascara available for women to beautify the lashes; and they are still a must have staple for your beauty bag!"

This unique liner is called I-Care because its treatment-like formula contains beneficial and nourishing ingredients perfect for the delicate eye area. Mineral oil-and preservative-free, I-Care is ophthalmologist-tested and specifically formulated for use around the eyes, even for those who wear contact lenses and have sensitive eyes. The highly smudge-proof formula helps to perfectly line the inner eyelid. A soft, flexible smudger is attached to the opposite end. Pull the smudger off, and you'll find a handy little sharpener tucked inside. Unlike most eye pencils, I-Care Eyeliner has a retractable point."

With Arcadia, a mesmerising new star is born: an intense perfume inspired by visions of exotic rain forests and desert sands from outer space. Paying homage to the mythological Arcadia, a powerful source of fine art inspiration throughout the centuries, Rouge Bunny Rouge founder Alexandra de Montfort and perfumer Sonia Constant (Givaudan) have created an idyllic extra-terrestrial landscape. In this contrasting Eau de Parfum the bold spirit of an intellectual challenge meets the spellbinding expectations of unseen pleasures. A woody metallic floral, Arcadia opens with fragrant harmonies of exotic trees glistening in the rain, an unspoilt otherworldly wilderness. In its heart, an intense bouquet of vibrant, fruity flowers is embraced by hot metallic and dry mineral notes. As the fragrance unfolds, all those facets - bitter, sweet, hot, cold, humid, dry and spicy \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c scintillate, adorning one another like electric sparks. Aristocratic, mischievous and ambrosial like an excellent white wine, Arcadia is a delicious artisanal fragrance.'

Now, you can easily color your way to complexion perfection with our new line of four creamy skin tone-evening sticks\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9deach with its own power to transform: Green instantly reduces redness, Lavender brightens sallowness/yellowness and Peach (for light skin) or Orange (for deeper skin) illuminates to conceal dark circles and hyper pigmentation. Downplay the aftermath of a late night or minimize the flush of rosacea\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dwith just a swipe of lush, blendable color. Color correction calls for spot-on application\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dmeaning, less is more.

This super-smooth, free-flowing pen lays down blacker-than-black lines with absolute precision. Our waterproof formula glides on without skipping or pulling, and the ultra fine tip provides an insane amount of control for a flawless application. Create thin, fine lines and bold, thick lines like a total pro\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9deven if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not! This pen is so good, even those who normally shy away from liquid liner will have their technique perfected in no time. Like all of our Perversion products, the color payoff is amazing (and intensely black!). And once you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve applied it, the ink dries down quickly; won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t smudge, run or feather; and lasts ALL day.'

Since we can never get enough color, we also wanted to expand our range with more dimensional shades and multiple finishes.

Even if it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s been all day since you applied, more Perversion always means more beautiful lashes. Our formula NEVER gets brittle or clumpy.\nPerversion Mascara contains Hairdensyl, a complex blend of proteins and amino acids\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dincluding marine glycogen, known to stimulate lash growth. Honey extract provides deep nourishment, sea idrolized elastine stimulates the hair follicle, and marine collagen protects.\nThe twisted trim on the high-tech, volumizing brush latches on to each lash to separate and define; finally, a volumizing mascara with a clean, clump-free finish. It pulls through lashes smoothly and lays down a generous amount of product. No need to wiggle the wand or maneuver it at all different angles!\nIf you need to apply in public, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll look good holding Perversion.

Ideal for travel (and loaded with a retractable lip brush), both of these super-sleek palettes were made for experimentation.

aS'The Dyson Supersonic\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 hair dryer has intelligent heat control technology, which helps prevent extreme heat damage to protect hair\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s natural shine. The temperature is measured 20 times a second and transmits this data to the microprocessor, which intelligently controls the patented compact heating element from reaching extreme, hair damaging temperatures. The powerful tool moves over 13 liters of air every second. Combined with Dyson\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s patented Air Multiplier\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 technology, air is amplified threefold, creating a high pressure, focused jet of air for controlled, precise, drying and styling. The digital motor V9 is on average six times faster, a third of the weight, and half the size of other hair dryer motors. Due to its compact size, Dyson was able to put the motor in the handle, making the dryer feel balanced in your hands.\nDyson has created three precisely engineered magnetic attachments with 16 patents pending, to further control the airflow, allowing you to effortlessly achieve a range of different styles. The smoothing nozzle uses smooth, wide air for a sleek finish, while the styling concentrator is for precise styling to shape hair one section at a time without worrying about disturbing the rest. The diffuser disperses air evenly around curls to gently dry hair and improve definition. With heat shield technology, the surfaces of the attachments stay cool\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9deven during close-up styling.\nThe Dyson Supersonic also has a removable filter at the bottom of the dryer that notifies you when it needs to be cleaned. It features four heat settings, three airflow settings, a cold shot, and ionizer, all with 1600 watts of power. This product comes with a professional-length nine-feet power cord and a two-year warranty on parts and labor. '

aS"Argan Oil is a 100% organic, chemical-free gift from nature. Its cosmetic and nutritional benefits have been the best-kept secret of Moroccan women for centuries and a secret that was whispered to me on a modeling shoot ten years ago. Moroccan argan oil is extracted from the nut of the argan tree, which grows only in the Moroccan desert. Argan oil is loaded with Vitamin E and essential fatty acids, so it has amazing healing, conditioning and repairing properties. Argan oil benefits your skin, hair, feet, nails, and even your baby's bottom. A moisturizer so pure you can use it on your baby, or use it to dress your salad? That's my idea of pure beauty. Argan Oil might not be able to solve all the world\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s problems, but when it comes to your body, there isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t much it can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s light enough to use as an everyday moisturizer, and powerful enough to soothe the symptoms of skin ailments like eczema or rosacea. "

It works! My Argan Oil Light absorbs even faster than the original. And it actually decreases sebum production with repeated use (sounds crazy but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s true). Get a semi-matte, radiant finish, no matter how oily your skin, and toss the blotting papers. This stuff is no lightweight when it comes to doing everything my original 100% Pure Argan Oil does: hydrating, balancing, repairing, replenishing. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just a shade less rich, for quicksilver absorption and a whisper-light feel.'
